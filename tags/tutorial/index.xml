      <description>Post covering how to build FreeBSD ports using poudriere and portshaker.
 Back to an old platonic love Lately, I had to came back to FreeBSD, and take over maintenance of some services deployed in FreeBSD.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been an happy FreeBSD years ago, I enjoyed this a lot, the handbook and other documentation are marvelous, many things &amp;ldquo;just works&amp;rdquo;, and I have a beard.
Long time ago I was also enjoying a very cool FreeBSD setup guide, from iMil.</description>
