      <description>Today I was contacted by a person asking for my terminal setup, after having seen it in a GitHub issue.
So even if most of my conf is already available in my dotfiles let&amp;rsquo;s share it here too in a more documented way, maybe someone may be interested by this too.
Obviously it&amp;rsquo;s for ZSH not bash. :P
Please also be waned that my dotfiles are a work in progress and quite messy/broken, some stuff are also quite obsolete.</description>
